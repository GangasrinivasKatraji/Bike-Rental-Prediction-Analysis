***🚴‍♂️ Bike Rental Prediction Analysis 🚴‍♀️***

***Project Overview***

This project delves into a bike-sharing dataset to analyze rental patterns and build predictive models for demand. Leveraging Python and machine learning techniques, we uncover insights into the factors influencing bike rentals and recommend the most accurate model for optimizing bike-sharing system operations.

***📊 Dataset Highlights***

Hourly and daily records of bike rentals
Environmental factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions)
Seasonal and temporal features (season, year, month, hour, weekday, holiday)

***🔍 Key Findings***

- 📈 Rentals peak in summer (clear weather) and dip in winter (poor weather).
- 💼 Weekdays see higher demand due to work commutes and activities.
- 🌡️ Temperature positively impacts rentals, but extreme heat can deter riders.
- 💧 Humidity negatively affects rentals, except at low levels.
- 💨 Wind speed has minimal impact, except in extreme cases.

***🤖 Machine Learning Models***

We evaluated the performance of five regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor 🌟
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- ***The Random Forest model emerged as the most accurate predictor, making it the recommended choice for production.***

***🛠️ Techniques Used***

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing (Standardization, One-Hot Encoding)
- Machine Learning Modeling (Scikit-Learn)
- Evaluation Metrics (RMSE, R² Score)

***📁 Repository Structure***

- Datasets/: Contains the raw .csv files for bike rental data.
